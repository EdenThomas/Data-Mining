# Data Mining Repository Structure

## Data Visualization
This directory contains a Jupyter notebook and supporting files for the data visualization project. The project analyzes and visualizes the Auto MPG dataset, providing insights into car specifications. It uses various statistical and visualization techniques to explore car specifications and their impact on fuel efficiency. 

**Key aspects of the project**:

Descriptive statistics for continuous and categorical variables.

Visualization techniques including histograms, box-plots, bar charts, treemaps etc.

Advanced analysis of relationships between variables using scatter plots, parallel coordinates plot, pearson corerlation etc.

## Clustering
This directory contains the clustering analysis project on the California Housing dataset. It includes hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering methods applied to the data, both in its original and standardized forms. 

**Key aspects of the project**:

Hierarchical clustering with five different linkage methods.

K-means clustering with an analysis of cluster counts ranging from 2 to 10.

Evaluation of clustering using various statistical methods and visualization.

## Tools and Technologies
**Python**: The primary programming language used across all projects.

**Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and presentation of analysis.

**Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Scikit-learn**: Libraries used for data manipulation, statistical analysis, visualization etc.
